# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Swin Transformer  
### A Smart, Scalable, and Conversational AI for Farmers

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Deployable on Low-Power Devices**  
  Model optimized for edge deployment, ideal for real-world farm use where high-end hardware isn't available.

- 🌍 **Supports 150+ Languages**  
  Frontend and chatbot are multilingual, ensuring accessibility across regions and user demographics.

- 💬 **AI Chatbot for Cure & Prevention**  
  Integrated AI assistant helps users understand symptoms and suggests preventive measures and treatments.

- 📸 **High-Accuracy Detection**  
  Achieved **98.94%** validation accuracy on a dataset of **100,000+ images** across **38 plant disease classes**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Model**: Swin Transformer (Vision Transformer)  
- **Training**: PyTorch, Adam optimizer, Cross-Entropy loss  
- **Frontend**: React.js (Multilingual UI)  
- **Backend**: Django REST API + AI-powered chatbot  
- **Deployment**: Lightweight model enables deployment on mobile and edge devices

## 🌱 Why This Project is Unique

Traditional plant disease models are often too large or require powerful hardware.  
This project stands out because:

- ✅ It's **lightweight**, **multilingual**, and **interactive**
- 🧑‍🌾 Designed for **real farmers**, not just academic benchmarks
- 🤖 Combines **state-of-the-art AI** with **practical usability**

## 🎯 Use Case

👨‍🌾 Farmers can:
1. 📸 Upload a leaf photo  
2. ✅ Get instant disease prediction  
3. 💬 Chat with the AI assistant to learn about causes, cures, and prevention — **in their native language**
